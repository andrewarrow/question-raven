This is an example Meteor project I started to learn how Meteor works.

I'm trying to duplicated a popular question/answer site functionality with meteor best practices.

Since this is my first time using meteor and meteor is very new (it's April 2012 as I write this)
I'm probably going to be making lots of changes as more information becomes available.
